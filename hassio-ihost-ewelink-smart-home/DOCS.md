# eWeLink Smart Home

## 1. Introduction

**eWeLink Smart Home** is designed to replace the legacy [eWeLink Smart Home](https://github.com/CoolKit-Technologies/ha-addon). It allows you to integrate devices under your eWeLink account into **Home Assistant** via **MQTT**, enabling device control and automation directly within Home Assistant. Simply log in with your eWeLink account to sync your devices into Home Assistant.

The legacy [eWeLink Smart Home](https://github.com/CoolKit-Technologies/ha-addon) app will **no longer be maintained or updated**. Some of its entity implementations rely on deprecated approaches, and the new project provides more robust and future-proof device support.
If you are currently using the old app, don’t worry — the new app includes a **data migration feature**. After migration, your existing devices and automations in Home Assistant will continue to work as before. Please refer to **Step 5** for the migration process.

---

## 2. Key Differences Between the New and Legacy eWeLink Smart Home Apps

1. The new app provides **more entities** for devices synced to Home Assistant, with implementations that better align with Home Assistant standards. It will continue to expand support for more devices and capabilities, including rapid support for new SONOFF products.
2. The new app **does not provide a UI for device control**. All control and automation are performed directly within Home Assistant.
3. The new app **no longer supports syncing Home Assistant devices back to the eWeLink cloud**, a feature that existed in the legacy app.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

1. MQTT integration and the **MQTT Broker app** are installed and enabled in Home Assistant.
2. You have registered an **eWeLink account** and added devices via the eWeLink mobile app.
3. **If you are using the legacy eWeLink Smart Home app and wish to migrate its data**, please first upgrade it to **version 1.4.6**, then stop the legacy app. During migration, the system will automatically stop the legacy app if it is still running. Refer to **Step 5** for details.

3. Wait for the installation to complete

---

### 4.3 About MQTT Configuration

We provide additional MQTT configuration options to accommodate users who rely on third-party MQTT brokers.
If you are not using a third-party MQTT broker, simply enable the app.
Once enabled, it will automatically start Home Assistant’s official Mosquitto broker and connect using the default credentials. No manual configuration is required. After successful startup, the app is ready to use.

---

### 4.4 Start the App

After installation, click **Start** to launch the app. Please wait until the service has fully started before continuing.

## 5. Migrating Data From the Legacy eWeLink Smart Home App

> If you do not need to migrate data from the legacy app, you may skip this section and proceed to **Step 6**.

### 5.1 **Important**: Upgrade the Legacy App to Version 1.4.6

Return to the legacy eWeLink Smart Home app and upgrade it to **version 1.4.6**.

**Conflict Detection**

To prevent data inconsistency, the legacy and new eWeLink Smart Home apps **cannot run simultaneously by default**.
After upgrading, you will see a configuration option called **Conflict Detection**, which is enabled by default.

-   If disabled, both apps can run at the same time, but data consistency is **not guaranteed**.
-   This configuration is **not recommended**.

---

### 5.2 Log In to the New App

Log in to the new eWeLink Smart Home app using the **same eWeLink account** as the legacy app.

1. Account login

---

### 5.3 Start Data Migration

After logging in, the system will automatically detect whether the same devices exist under both the new and legacy apps. If matching devices are found, you will be prompted to migrate data.

You may choose to migrate immediately or defer until the next login.

#### 5.3.1 Start Migration

Click **Migrate Now** to begin.
During migration:

-   Keep Home Assistant and the new app running.
-   Do not interrupt or close the process.
-   Home Assistant Core will be restarted once during migration.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iHost-Open-Source-Project/hassio-ihost-addon/refs/heads/master/hassio-ihost-ewelink-smart-home/images/migrate-now.png)

#### 5.3.2 Stop the Legacy App

To ensure data integrity, the system will automatically stop the legacy app.

If stopping fails (for example, if the legacy app is running in a standalone container), manually stop it and then return to the new app page and click **Stopped, Continue Migration**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iHost-Open-Source-Project/hassio-ihost-addon/refs/heads/master/hassio-ihost-ewelink-smart-home/images/stopping-addon.png)

#### 5.3.3 Migration in Progress

Once the legacy app has stopped successfully, data migration will begin automatically.
Home Assistant Core will restart once, typically taking **2–3 minutes**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iHost-Open-Source-Project/hassio-ihost-addon/refs/heads/master/hassio-ihost-ewelink-smart-home/images/migrate-data.png)

#### 5.3.4 Migration Completed

After a successful migration, devices previously added to Home Assistant via the legacy app will appear as **synced** in the new app.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iHost-Open-Source-Project/hassio-ihost-addon/refs/heads/master/hassio-ihost-ewelink-smart-home/images/migrate-complete.png)

#### 5.3.5 Cancel Migration

You may cancel migration at any time before it begins. After cancellation, logging out and back in will trigger the migration prompt again.

#### 5.3.6 Unexpected Exit

If you exit the new app UI or restart the app during migration, the migration process will **continue uninterrupted**.

---

### 5.4 Skip Migration

If you choose not to migrate, devices previously added via the legacy app will not be synced.
When syncing devices in the new app, **new devices and entities** will be created in Home Assistant.
