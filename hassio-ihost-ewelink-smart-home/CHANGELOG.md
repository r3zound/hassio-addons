# Changelog

This add-on is designed to replace the legacy **eWeLink Smart Home** add-on, enabling devices under your eWeLink account to be synchronized with **Home Assistant** and controlled via either the local network or the cloud. The legacy eWeLink Smart Home add-on will no longer be maintained or updated, as some of its entity implementations rely on deprecated methods. The new project delivers more robust, future-oriented device support.

## 1.2.1

### Changed

* Optimized the WebSocket connection mechanism with Home Assistant

## 1.2.0

### Added

* Added support for the relay separation mode on MINIR4/MINIR4M/SN-ESP32D0-MINIR4-01(138)/CK-ESP32C3-SW-MT2(138)
  Note: The relay separation mode requires device firmware support. If this feature is not available on your device, please upgrade the device firmware to the latest version and try again.
* Added support for syncing sub-devices under NSPanel Pro Gen2 and Bridge-M to Home Assistant

### Changed

* If MQTT configuration has already been filled in at startup, core-mosquitto will no longer be forcibly installed

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where the temperature of SNZB-02LD could not be reported properly
* Fixed an occasional issue where devices could not be controlled when the Add-on restarted after restarting Home Assistant

## 1.1.0

### Added

- Added support for syncing 70+ device types from your eWeLink account to Home Assistant. These devices can be controlled via LAN or the cloud.

### Changed

- Optimized the online and offline status logic for RF Bridge devices

## 1.0.4

### Added

- Introduced a Button entity for the following device models:
  POW / POWR3 / S31 / THR316 / THR316D / THR320 / THR320D / S40TPB / S40TPA / POWR316D / POWR320D / POWR316 / POWCT / S60TPF / S60TP.
  Pressing the button initiates a temporary active reporting cycle (default interval: 60 seconds), during which the device periodically pushes state updates to Home Assistant. The specific reported states depend on the device model.

## 1.0.3

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where eWeLink accounts could be automatically logged out under certain conditions.

## 1.0.2

### Changed

- Improved the reconnection mechanism after a network outage.
- Improved the online/offline handling for certain devices.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where devices could not be synchronized if an RF Bridge had no sub-devices.

## 1.0.1

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the configured third-party MQTT broker could not be used properly.

## 1.0.0

### Added
