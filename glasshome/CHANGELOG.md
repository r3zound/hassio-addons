# Changelog

## 1.0.0

GlassHome v1. Everything since 0.10.0:

### New Features

- A short, personal welcome note the first time you open GlassHome.
- Add a phone or tablet by scanning a QR code, with no tokens to copy. Devices without a camera can enter a 6-digit code on an on-screen numpad instead, and you see clear progress while it connects.
- Settings now tells you when a newer version of GlassHome is available, showing the version you're on and the one to update to.
- Widgets can use icons from any icon set, not just a small built-in selection. Icons are cached on your box after first use, so they keep working offline, and they no longer flicker or shift while you scroll.
- Turn off every light or lock every door straight from the dashboard header: the lights and lock chips are now buttons.

### Improvements

- The dashboard's frosted-glass blur is faster and lighter, especially with many widgets on screen. A new Blur setting lets you choose: Performant (the new default, the same look at a fraction of the cost), Dynamic (real-time and most accurate, heaviest on the device), or None (solid surfaces, the lightest option).
- Remote access lives in one place: a single card for the managed GlassHome tunnel and your own addresses (a home reverse proxy, a VPN, or your own tunnel). A reverse proxy at home is free; a public address needs Pro.
- The mobile app now works away from home, reaching Home Assistant securely through your dashboard server. Album art and camera images load over remote access too, not just on your home network.
- No more dead ends when you're away: if Home Assistant can't be reached, that option is clearly marked unavailable with what to do instead, rather than a browser error page.
- A redesigned sign-in screen with clear, colour-coded options, the best one for your situation highlighted, your home's name shown, and your Home Assistant address filled in for you.
- Browsing and adding widgets share one cleaner card layout, with a tidy search-and-filter bar and a side-by-side view of the widget you're inspecting.
- The Area widget was redesigned as a clean column of tiles, making each light, switch, and sensor easier to see and tap.
- Installing a community widget shows one clear permission dialog instead of two, listing exactly what it wants access to, with a "How widgets are kept safe" explainer.
- Pro now covers your whole home: when one member has Pro, every member, kiosk, and family phone gets Pro too, and it keeps working for two weeks if your home goes offline.
- Settings shows you and your home together in a single household card, and the Devices screen groups connected devices by person and clears out stale sessions.
- Widgets download as smaller, faster bundles and update automatically after you upgrade.
- Badges and buttons across Settings got a visual refresh: frosted status chips, polished gradient Pro and Early Bird badges, and pill-shaped buttons. Dropdown menus have a consistent size and no longer waste space on mobile.
- The dashboard header temperature matches the unit you set in Home Assistant, switching between °C and °F with it.

### Security

- Community widgets ask permission before touching your home and can only do what you approve; if a widget ever tries to do more, the attempt is blocked and you get a notification. Each widget runs in its own isolated space, can't interfere with the rest of your dashboard, and can never send your home's data anywhere except your Home Assistant and GlassHome. Widgets never see your Home Assistant login, and your Home Assistant token is no longer handed to the browser. A help page explains, in plain language, what widgets can and cannot do: glasshome.app/docs/widget-security.

### Fixes

- Signing in with your GlassHome account reliably lands you on your home and your dashboards, instead of an empty page or a duplicate "Home". Connecting your account from Settings fixes accounts stuck on earlier versions and cleans up the duplicate profile automatically. Failed sign-ins now show a clear message instead of a silent dead end.
- Home Assistant admins are admins in GlassHome too, so you can manage your home's members; your role updates on your next sign-in. Every home always has a dashboard, restored on next sign-in if yours was missing.
- Sign-in works behind a reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS, and Home Assistant error messages show the real text instead of "[object Object]".
- Notification banners show the correct colours in light mode and under custom themes.
- Performant Blur (the default) now works on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Changing your background updates the frosted glass instantly, and the frosted look is identical in every blur mode.
- Widgets size correctly across more tile shapes, no longer look too small right after the opening animation, and "ghost" tiles no longer linger in empty slots.
- Reduce Blur and Reduce Motion now apply inside widgets too, and in dark mode widgets follow your custom theme's colours and corner roundness.
- A widget that fails to auto-update quietly retries once before showing an error, and widgets no longer freeze when switching between dashboards.
- The interactive demo loads with every widget fully styled, and each visitor gets their own private demo that tidies itself up afterward.
- The Home Assistant logo was updated to its current mark, and the icon next to a page's title is properly centred.

## 0.10.0

Highlights since 0.9.6:

### New Features

- Sign in with a GlassHome account. Start the sign-in from settings and approve it by entering a short code at glasshome.app/link. Your dashboard knows you across devices, no password typed on the TV or tablet.
- GlassHome Pro. Community widgets and custom theming are now part of Pro. Free dashboards keep the full built-in widget set; a clear upgrade prompt appears when you reach for a Pro-only feature.
- Editing your dashboard is clearer: the page dims behind the widgets, each widget gets crisp corner buttons for move, remove, and resize, and holding a widget opens its settings directly.
- Try a demo home. From the welcome screen you can explore a fully populated dashboard, Pro features included, before connecting your own Home Assistant.
- Pair a second screen with Quick-Connect. A kiosk or extra tablet shows a short code you confirm once, instead of copying tokens by hand.
- Theme cards in the theme picker now show each theme's actual background and color palette, plus a new sharp Monochrome look with a diamond grid background and a scattered-trees pattern for Forest Zen.
- Icons now load without an internet connection. Entity, area, and dock icons come straight from your own server instead of an external icon service.

### Improvements

- Redesigned welcome and setup. A calmer, conversational onboarding walks you through connecting your home one step at a time.
- Reworked Settings. Your account and your home live in clearly separated cards, Settings → Your Home lists every member with their role, and a new "Reduce Motion" toggle dials back animations.
- Widgets you drop on the dashboard appear at a readable size by default instead of the 1x1 minimum.
- Searching for an entity by its friendly name works in every widget picker.
- Faster installs and updates. The add-on download is about a third smaller.

### Bug Fixes

- Upgrading from 0.9.x preserves your dashboards, placed widgets, and custom themes.
- Homes sharing one server are fully separated: community widgets, custom themes, and background updates belong to your home only.
- Dashboard reconnects to Home Assistant automatically after the app comes back from the background.
- Drag and resize work immediately after adding the first widget to a fresh dashboard.
- Batteries widget shows your batteries on setups where it used to come up empty.

## 0.9.6

### Improvements

- Widget colors are more vibrant, especially at low opacity and in dark mode. Icons stay readable against their tinted backgrounds.
- Climate widget mode colors (heat, cool, auto, off) render distinctly in both light and dark themes instead of washing out.

### Bug Fixes

- Widgets that need a newer dashboard than yours no longer get auto-installed and broken. Auto-update now skips incompatible versions and tells you why.
- Climate widget no longer crashes when debug info is open.
- Widget tiles render correctly on existing dashboards after updating.
- Updating to a new dashboard release no longer leaves older bundled code lingering in your browser's cache. Updates take effect on first reload.

## 0.9.5

### New Features

- Drag a widget into the top or bottom edge of the screen and the page autoscrolls. Long dashboards no longer require dropping a tile mid-move.
- Active dashboard in the dock is highlighted by a sliding pill indicator that animates between items.
- Mobile bottom-sheet rebuilt in-house: smoother drag-to-dismiss with velocity, proper keyboard avoidance, nested sheets, and popovers that no longer fight the stacking context.

### Improvements

- Mobile widget gestures redesigned. Tap toggles, long-press (500 ms with haptic bump on supported devices) opens the detail dialog. Fine control — sliders, color, presets — lives in the dialog. Page scroll over widgets is now snappy and predictable. Mouse and pen retain in-tile tap, hold, and slide.
- Edit mode pickup on mobile requires a 300 ms long-press with haptic confirmation, so a quick swipe through the dashboard no longer accidentally grabs a tile. Page scroll passes through the gaps between widgets.
- Resize handle hit target enlarged to 44×44 (visual grip unchanged), so even 1×1 tiles are resizable with a finger.
- Settings "Home Assistant" section uses the Home Assistant logo. Status chips on the dashboard and settings are now compact and consistently sized.
- Empty dashboards scroll and center properly in the viewport.

### Bug Fixes

- Widgets react to Home Assistant state changes in production again. Tapping a widget would toggle the entity in HA but the dashboard UI stayed frozen until refresh — a vendor-build module duplication caused entity subscriptions to never be sent.
- Background layer tracks the large viewport on mobile (100lvh) so it no longer repaints when browser chrome collapses on scroll.
- Web theme defaults to dark so the browser experience matches the native shell.
- Widget picker config dialog no longer flickers on close.
- Stale signal write during grid teardown silenced.

### Under the Hood

- @glasshome/ui 0.2.1 → 0.2.2 (drops @corvu/drawer)
- @glasshome/widget-sdk 0.3.4 → 0.3.7 (gesture grammar split by pointer type, touch-action derived from config)

- Responsive layout that scales down cleanly to phone-sized screens; edit-mode buttons collapse to icons on mobile

### Unified Settings Shell

- Settings pages now share the same glass header and status chips as the dashboard
- Consistent navigation, spacing, and look across every settings screen

### Bug Fixes

- Uninstall failures now show plain-English messages (demo-mode block, server error, network failure) instead of leaking raw error text from the backend
- Long-pressing a widget on mobile no longer accidentally selects text inside the tile or carries that highlight into the dialog you opened
- Switching dashboards from the settings page now actually opens the dashboard you picked, and the choice survives a page reload
- Switching between dashboards no longer briefly shows widgets from the previous dashboard — fixed a race that left stale instances on screen for a frame
- First-install demo content rebuilt: three curated dashboards (Home, Bedroom, Energy) wired to the dock with correct layouts
- Home dashboard weather widget pointed at a real demo entity so it shows data out of the box
