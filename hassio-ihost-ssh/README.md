## About

This add-on allows you to log in to your Home Assistant instance using
SSH or a Web Terminal, giving you access to your folders and
also includes a command-line tool to perform actions such as restart, update,
and check your instance.

This is an enhanced version of the provided
[SSH add-on by Home Assistant][hass-ssh] and focuses on security,
usability, flexibility and also provides access via a web interface.

## WARNING

The advanced SSH & Web Terminal add-on is a very powerful tool that gives you
virtual access to all tools and almost all hardware on your system.

While this add-on is created and maintained with care and with security in mind,
in the wrong or inexperienced hands, it could potentially damage your system.

## Features

This add-on, of course, provides an SSH server, based on [OpenSSH][openssh] and
a web-based Terminal (which can be included in your Home Assistant frontend) as
well. Additionally, it comes with the following features:

- Access your command line directly from the Home Assistant frontend!
- A secure default configuration for SSH:
  - Only allows login by the configured user, even if more users are created.
  - Only uses known secure ciphers and algorithms.
  - Limits login attempts to better defend against brute-force attacks.
- Includes an SSH compatibility mode option to allow older clients to connect.
- Supports Mosh, enabling roaming and intermittent connectivity.
- SFTP support is disabled by default but is user configurable.
- Compatible if Home Assistant was installed via the generic Linux installer.
- Username is customizable, so `root` is no longer mandatory.
- Persists custom SSH client settings & keys between add-on restarts
- Log levels for easier issue triaging.
- Hardware access to your audio, uart/serial devices, and GPIO pins.
- Runs with elevated privileges, allowing you to debug and test more scenarios.
- Has access to the host system's dbus.
- Option to access the Docker instance running on the host system.
- Operates on the host network level, enabling you to open ports or run small daemons.
- Installs custom Alpine packages on startup. This lets you install
  your preferred tools, which will be available every time you log in.
- Executes custom commands on add-on startup, allowing you to customize the
  shell to your preferences.
- [ZSH][zsh] as its default shell. Easier to use for beginners, more advanced
  for experienced users. It even comes preloaded with
  ["Oh My ZSH"][ohmyzsh], with some plugins enabled as well.
- Comes with a sensible set of tools out of the box: curl, Wget, RSync, GIT,
  Nmap, Mosquitto client, MariaDB/MySQL client, Awake (“wake on LAN”), Nano,
  Vim, tmux, and a variety of commonly used networking tools.
