## 1. Introduction

SONOFF Dongle Flasher supports online firmware flashing for the iHost MG21 chip and the SONOFF Dongle series (ZBDongle-P, ZBDongle-E, Dongle-M, Dongle-PMG24, Dongle-LMG21, Dongle-PZG23 and Dongle-MZG23).

In addition to the SONOFF Dongle Flasher app, we also provide a [container version](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewelink/sonoff-dongle-flasher).

## 2. Prerequisite

Before using the app, please make sure the serial port is not in use (it is commonly occupied by services like Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA).
During the firmware flashing process, the app will attempt to connect to the device and automatically check whether the serial port is occupied.
If it is, the app will try to stop the conflicting service for you.

## 4. Use the **SONOFF Dongle Flasher App** to flash Zigbee firmware

Open the web interface and click **"Connect"**. The tool will automatically scan for the iHost MG21 chip and connected Zigbee Dongles on the device running Home Assistant.
(Currently, only **SONOFF ZBDongle-P**, **SONOFF ZBDongle-E**, **SONOFF Dongle-M**, **SONOFF Dongle-PMG24**, **SONOFF Dongle-LMG21**, **SONOFF Dongle-PZG23** and **SONOFF Dongle-MZG23** are supported.)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iHost-Open-Source-Project/hassio-ihost-addon/master/hassio-ihost-sonoff-dongle-flasher/images/MG21_connect_scan.png)

> </font><font color="red">Note\*</font> Before clicking **Connect**, please make sure that **Zigbee2MQTT** and **ZHA** are stopped.Flashing requires access to the serial port, and currently, the app will automatically check whether the iHost serial port is occupied by Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA when you click **Connect**.
>
> If either service is running, the app will attempt to stop them automatically.
>
> If Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA is not stopped beforehand, you may encounter device connection failures during the flashing process.\*

### 4.1 Flashing Zigbee NCP Firmware to iHost Internal MG21 Chip

4. Click **"Flash"** to start flashing the firmware.
   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iHost-Open-Source-Project/hassio-ihost-addon/master/hassio-ihost-sonoff-dongle-flasher/images/MG21_Flash.png)
5. Wait for the flashing process to complete.
   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iHost-Open-Source-Project/hassio-ihost-addon/master/hassio-ihost-sonoff-dongle-flasher/images/MG21_Flash_success.png)
    > </font><font color="red">Note\*</font> If you plan to switch iHost back from Home Assistant to the CUBE system, please first flash the Zigbee firmware back to **version 6.10.9**.Otherwise, data loss or compatibility issues may occur.
    >
    > Or If you upgrade the firmware directly to **version 7.4 or above**, make sure to initially configure Zigbee2MQTT to use the **ezsp** adapter.Only after Zigbee2MQTT successfully starts with ezsp, you may reconfigure it to use the **ember** adapter.
    >
    > **Do not skip this process and directly use the ember adapter**, or you may encounter the following risks:_ Starting Zigbee2MQTT with the ember adapter may trigger an error:_"The backup file was created from an unsupported EZSP version."\*This may force you to reconfigure your entire Zigbee network.
    >
    > **Details**: See the [GitHub discussion on v7.4+ firmware compatibility](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/discussions/22919).

> </font><font color="red">Note\*</font> When manually flashing firmware to the ZBDongle-P, the progress may sometimes get stuck at 0%.
>
> **Possible causes:**
>
> -   Mismatched model: The selected device model is ZBDongle-E, but the device connected > to the specified serial port is ZBDongle-P.
> -   As a result, the serial port is occupied and cannot be used for another attempt.
>
> **Please try:**
>
> -   Restart the App to release the serial port.
> -   Verify and select the correct de vice model matching your device (ZBDongle-P).
> -   Flash the firmware again.
